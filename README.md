# Indy-Packets
Cross platform tcp packet client and server using Indy

Testing my Indy Packet Client/Servers on Android.

Compiled and tested with Delphi 11 with included Indy.
Should also compile and work with Delphi 10.1 Berlin.

Client Demo is using Base3d.
Server is simple fmx app.

Client Tested on both Windows and Android against the ICS Packet Server Demo.
Server also tests clean on both Windows and Android.
Doesn't do alot again just a little test of the engine.
