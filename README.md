# Indy-Packets
Cross platform tcp packet client and server using Indy

Testing my Indy Packet Client for Android.

Compiled and tested with Delphi 11 with included Indy.
Should also compile and work with Delphi 10.1 Berlin.

Demo is using Base3d.

Tested on both Windows and Android against the ICP Packet Server Demo.
Doesn't do alot again just a little test of the engine.
